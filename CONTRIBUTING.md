## Suggesting Enhancements

Got a great idea for a new game mode? Or need a new tracker for some new aspect of Magic? Or just thought of a clever feature for an existing app let us know!

1. Review the [open enhancements](https://github.com/egreer/magic.jibbermaster.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) to see if it is already in the works. If the feature is there give it a :thumbsup: to show your support.
2. If not, open a `New Issue` with any relevant information about how the feature should work and any links to rules or blogs about the game mode that could help the developers implement the feature.

## Reporting Bugs

If there is an issue while using the app we want to get as much information as possible to help reproduce and fix the bug.

1. Review the [open issues](https://github.com/egreer/magic.jibbermaster.com/issues) to see if someone else has reported this same problem. If they have give it a :thumbsup: to show your support.
2. If not, open a `New Issue` with any information. Please provide as much information about which feature this bug occurred in, the steps to reproduce the bug and what cards were displayed.

## Local Development

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start` Runs the app in the development mode.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Formatting is performed with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) to help enforce consistency with the best practices of the larger community.

## Pull Requests

When opening a Pull Request please reference an existing issue or open a relevant issue. Be sure to mention that issue number in the PR. This helps track the discussions and preserves the issue for future reference.

- Please describe the steps needed to test the feature or bug you are fixing.
- Try to keep the Pull Request relevant to the issue at hand. If you want to refactor or rearrange a bunch of code, open a second PR that just does the refactor to separate it from the bug you are fixing.
- Add any notes about complicated or unique changes you feel could use additional explanation.
