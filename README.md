This is a passion project for all aspects of Magic the Gathering. It is a go to tool for casual players who want to supplement their play group's experience with formats like Planechase, Archenemy, or Vanguard without having to carry the cards to every event.

Game night getting stale? Add a bit of randomness with a random game mode selector, SYB direction guide, or even the topsy-turvy Hike Mode.

Board state too crazy? Keep track of all the Slivers effects, setup all the Contraptions, Attractions or other in game mechanics easily from your phone.

## Tools

### [SYB](https://magic.jibbermaster.com/syb)
